\subsubsection{Transformation Algorithm for Max N Analysis}
Given a top level fault hypothesis statement of maximum $N$ faults, the transformation algorithm filters out any MinCutSets of cardinality greater than $N$. To assist in performance and scalability, if a minimum cut set exceeds the cardinality of $N$, it will no longer be considered for the algorithm. We call this \textit{pruning}. This pruning is done in Algorithm 2 in Section~\ref{sec:transformation}. If the number of faults in an intermediate set $I$ exceeds $N$, any further replacement of remaining contracts in that intermediate set can never decrease the total number of faults in $I$. Only the remaining sets are displayed.
