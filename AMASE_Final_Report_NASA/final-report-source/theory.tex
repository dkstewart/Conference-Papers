\section{Theoretical Foundations}
\label{sec:theory}
%As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}, there are two different types of analysis that can be performed on a fault model. The initial stages of the project implemented a \textit{Verify in the Presence of Faults} analysis that returned a single counterexample if a fault caused violation of a property. In later stages of this project, this was extended in order to collect all such fault combinations that caused these violations, \textit{Generate Minimal Cut Sets}. 

There are two different types of fault analysis that can be performed on a fault model, \textit{Verification in the Presence of Faults}, and \textit{Generate Minimal Cut Sets}, as introduced in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}. The theoretical foundations used to verify a model in the presence of faults relies on AGREE and the theory underlying the assume guarantee environment~\cite{cofer2012compositional}; this theory will not be discussed further in this report. The underlying theoretical framework used in the generation of minimal cut sets is described in detail in this section.
